== About Me
I am a fourth year PhD student in the EECS department at UC Berkeley, co-adivsed by [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/ Ben Recht] and [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/ Michael Jordan]. I am supported by an NSF GRFP grant and a Berkeley Fellowship. Previously, I recieved a BA in Mathematics at Princeton University, where I was fortunate enough to do research with [https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/ Sanjeev Arora] and [http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/ David Blei] (who taught at Princeton at the time). 

My research interests are in *machine learning*, *active learning*, *optimization* and *control*. Currently, I'm interested in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08334.pdf provable bounds for learning in time series], active learning and experiment design for learning and classification, and the [https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01221 connections between sequential inference and the average-case complexity of optimization problems].
