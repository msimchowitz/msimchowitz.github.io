abstract: "AI has seem tremendous advances in discrete and symbolic reasoning. And yet, reliable AI in the physical world - from robotics, to autonomous driving, to accurate weather prediction to fully automated smart grid - still pose major challenges. 

Beyond pragmatic challenges like the availability of data and the costs of operating on  physical hardware, this talk will argue that there are unique and fundamental challenges when getting machine learning methods to work on physical systems. Using robotic imitation learning as a didactic example, we will demonstrate mathematical results that reveal error propagation through dynamic environments can lead to exponentially greater data requirements than what we might expect in discrete domains. 

On the positive side, we show how certain remedies, like the hitherto-mysterious practice of “action-chunking,” partially surmount these difficulties,  and that a mixture of “imperfect” and “expert” data is strictly better than expert data alone.  Yet, despite these solutions, we will conclude by describing some preliminary work suggesting that there are still major empirical limitations of the state of art methods in continuous control, and will outline some of the most promising directions to overcoming them.
