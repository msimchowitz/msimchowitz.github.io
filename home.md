## About Me
I am a fourth year PhD student in the EECS department at UC Berkeley, co-adivsed by [Ben Recht](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/) and [Michael Jordan] (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/ ). I am supported by an NSF GRFP grant and a Berkeley Fellowship. Previously, I recieved a BA in Mathematics at Princeton University, where I was fortunate enough to do research with [Sanjeev Arora] (https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/) and [David Blei] (http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/ ) (who taught at Princeton at the time). 

My research interests are in *machine learning*, *active learning*, *optimization* and *control*. Currently, I'm interested in [provable bounds for learning in time series] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08334.pdf), active learning and experiment design for learning and classification, and the [connections between sequential inference and the average-case complexity of optimization problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01221).
